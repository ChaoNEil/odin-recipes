        <p><em>" Is it possible for four kids to cook together without total chaos in the kitchen? 
            Yes, with the right recipe! This cinnamon roll monkey bread is a favorite with my bunch. They get to "play" as 
            they roll pieces of refrigerated biscuit dough into balls. —<strong>Lisa Lisa</strong>, Greenville, Ohio</em></p>
