        <p><em>" This fork-tender Swiss steak with rich gravy was an often-requested main dish around our house when I was growing up. 
            Mom took pride in preparing scrumptious, hearty meals like this for our family and guests. —<strong>Lara Croft</strong>, Earth.</em></p>

                    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325°. In a large shallow dish, combine flour, salt and pepper. Pound steak with a mallet to tenderize. Add meat, a few pieces at a time, and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>In an ovenproof Dutch oven, brown steak in oil on both sides. Arrange onion slices between layers of meat. Add water and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
            <li>Cover and bake 2 to 2-1/2 hours or until meat is very tender. Remove meat to a serving platter and keep warm.</li>
            <li>For gravy, in a small bowl, combine flour, salt, pepper and broth until smooth; stir into pan juices. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir 
                2 minutes or until thickened. Serve steak and gravy with noodles or mashed potatoes, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
